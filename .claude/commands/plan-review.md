# Plan Mode Review

Review and validate a plan before implementation using a structured multi-phase process.

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS

## Steps

1. Load the `plan-mode-review` skill and read its reference files
2. Ask the user to select a mode:
   - **Big Change** — Phase 0 + all 5 review sections (up to 4 issues each)
   - **Small Change** — Phase 0 + top issue per section only
   - **Review Only** — Skip Phase 0, go straight to 5 review sections
3. Execute the selected workflow per the skill's process
4. Maintain a Decision Log throughout — update after each section
5. Present findings using the Structured Question Format from `review-interaction-protocol.md`
6. Verify the Production Readiness Gate before final approval
7. Summarize all decisions and next steps
