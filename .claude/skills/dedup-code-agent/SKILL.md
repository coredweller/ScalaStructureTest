# Code Deduplication Skill

## Purpose

Provides systematic methodology for detecting code duplication, unused code, and dependency bloat -- primarily in Flutter + Firebase codebases but applicable to any project.

## Process

1. **Discover** -- Map project structure, features, shared utilities, and test coverage
2. **Scan** -- Run multi-phase analysis for duplicates, dead code, and unused dependencies
3. **Classify** -- Categorize findings by severity (Critical / Warning / Suggestion)
4. **Report** -- Output structured report with file locations, counts, and recommendations

For the complete analysis methodology, detection patterns, and report format:

Read [reference/dedup-analysis-methodology.md](reference/dedup-analysis-methodology.md)

## Error Handling

If the target directory does not exist, report "Target not found" with the path searched.
If no duplication is found, report "No duplicates detected" with the scan scope and file count.
